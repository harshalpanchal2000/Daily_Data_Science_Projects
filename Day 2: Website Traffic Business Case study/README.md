# Data Science Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This data project was designed as a take-home assignment for the recruitment process for data science positions at Linkfire. The primary objective is to analyze website traffic data to gain insights into the volume and distribution of events. The ultimate goal is to develop ideas to improve the click rates of the provided links.

## Problem Statement

The main questions addressed in this project are as follows:

1. **Total Pageview Events:** Determine the total number of pageview events the links received during the entire period and calculate the average number of pageviews per day.

2. **Other Recorded Events:** Explore and analyze the distribution of other recorded events, excluding pageviews.

3. **Countries of Pageviews:** Identify the countries from which the pageviews originated.

4. **Overall Click Rate:** Calculate the overall click rate, defined as the ratio of clicks to pageviews.

5. **Click Rate Distribution Across Links:** Investigate how the click rate is distributed across different links.

6. **Correlation Between Clicks and Previews:** Examine the correlation between the number of clicks and previews on a link. Evaluate the significance and magnitude of the effect, considering potential linear and categorical relationships.

## Tools Used

The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on the Pandas and SciPy libraries for data manipulation and statistical analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the provided dataset and exploring its structure.

2. **Total Pageview Events:** Determining the total pageview events and calculating the average per day.

3. **Other Recorded Events:** Analyzing the distribution of events other than pageviews.

4. **Countries of Pageviews:** Identifying the countries from which the pageviews originated.

5. **Overall Click Rate:** Calculating and interpreting the overall click rate.

6. **Click Rate Distribution Across Links:** Visualizing the distribution of click rates across different links.

7. **Correlation Between Clicks and Previews:** Investigating the correlation and potential relationships between the number of clicks and previews.

## Conclusion

The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of website traffic, allowing for informed strategies to improve link click rates. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of user engagement and can serve as a basis for data-driven decision-making in optimizing the performance of links.
