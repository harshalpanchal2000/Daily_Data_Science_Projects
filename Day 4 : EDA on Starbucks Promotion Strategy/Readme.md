# Starbucks Promotional Strategy Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes the effectiveness of a promotional strategy conducted by Starbucks to increase product purchases. The dataset provided contains information about customers who were either exposed to the promotion (treatment group) or not (control group), along with various features that may influence their purchase behavior.

## Dataset Description
- **ID:** Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Promotion:** Indicates whether the customer received the promotion (Yes) or not (No).
- **Purchase:** Binary variable indicating whether the customer made a purchase (1) or not (0).
- **V1-V7:** Numerical features representing customer attributes.
- **promotion_encoded:** Encoded version of the "Promotion" column using label encoding.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots, and correlation analysis were conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics.
2. **Relationship between Control & Treatment Groups:** Proportion analysis and comparison of purchase rates between treatment and control groups.
3. **Calculating IRR & NIR:** Incremental Response Rate (IRR) and Net Incremental Revenue (NIR) were computed to evaluate the promotion's impact.
4. **Insights & Recommendations:** Interpretation of results and recommendations for optimizing promotional strategies.

## Results
- **Net Incremental Revenue (NIR):** The promotion resulted in a negative NIR, indicating a loss in revenue.
- **Incremental Response Rate (IRR):** The IRR was negative, suggesting a decrease in the response rate due to the promotion.

## Conclusion
The promotional strategy employed by Starbucks did not yield favorable results in terms of revenue generation and customer response. Further adjustments or alternative strategies may be necessary to improve effectiveness.
